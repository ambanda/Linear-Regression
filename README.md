The Impact of Legalized Abortion on Crime

Could abortion influence the rate of crime in later years? 
Women having a right to chose when to have children might be beneficial to society after all. 
The study was conducted to evaluate the impacts that abortion could cause on crime rate in subsequent years. 
The study postulated that legalizing abortion had a positive impact on crime rate reduction. 
The study analysed abortion rates from 1990-2000 and the crime rate from 2010-2020 in different states that legalized abortion within those years and how has it changed the crime rates 20 years later

The variables of the focus were; 
crime rates as our dependant variable, 
abortion rates, police per capita and unemployment as independent variables.

Control variable;
We set unemployment and police per capita as our control variable
